The model would approve a credit card for someone who is actually a bad customer (likely to default) the bank loses money if the applicant with a poor credit history gets approved, and later fails to pay.

    "## Bar Plot Interpretation: Model Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The bar plot compares four key evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score, across Random Forest, baseline XGBoost, and tuned XGBoost models on the test set. \n",
    "The main task is to identify defaulters (1) versus non-defaulters (0), in a dataset with a strong class imbalance (far fewer defaulters).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Accuracy\n",
    "All three models achieve very high accuracy (around 95.8% to 96%). However, in this imbalanced dataset, where defaulters are much less common than non-defaulters, high accuracy is not a strong indicator of real-world performance. Most of this accuracy comes from correctly predicting the majority class (non-defaulters), while performance on the minority class (defaulters) is what truly matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Precision, Recall, and F1-score\n",
    "Precision indicates how often a predicted defaulter is actually a defaulter. The values are fairly low (0.17 to 0.19), reflecting the difficulty in making correct positive predictions due to class imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall measures how many actual defaulters the model successfully identifies. Here, the tuned XGBoost achieves the highest recall (0.455), followed closely by baseline XGBoost (0.447), and then Random Forest (0.366).\n",
    "\n",
    "F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, representing the overall balance between the two. The tuned XGBoost has the highest F1-score (0.271), indicating the best trade-off between precision and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Random Forest achieves the lowest precision, recall, and F1-score among the three, but still provides a meaningful baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Baseline XGBoost improves upon Random Forest, especially in terms of recall and F1-score, suggesting it’s better at finding defaulters and balancing false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tuned XGBoost slightly outperforms both Random Forest and baseline XGBoost on all key metrics, demonstrating that hyperparameter tuning has helped the model become even more effective at detecting defaulters."

    "In the context of credit default prediction, it is crucial to find the right balance between identifying true defaulters and minimizing false alarms. The precision-recall curve is a valuable tool for visualizing this trade-off, as it shows how precision (the proportion of correctly identified defaulters among all predicted defaulters) and recall (the proportion of actual defaulters correctly identified by the model) change as we adjust the classification threshold. In practical terms, if our main concern is to avoid lending to customers who are likely to default, we may prioritize a higher recall, accepting a greater number of false positives to ensure we capture as many defaulters as possible. Conversely, if we want to avoid mistakenly classifying reliable customers as risky, we might set a higher threshold to achieve higher precision, even if it means some defaulters go undetected. By analyzing the precision-recall curve, we can select a threshold that aligns with our institution’s risk appetite and business objectives, ensuring our credit decision process is both responsible and aligned with our strategic goals.\n"
